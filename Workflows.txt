Workflows:

Scenario 1: Export & Commit

	Start Conditions:
		Working with .mdb in folder that is a Git repo.
		Addin has been installed.
		
	End Condition:
		All relevant items present as text files in /src folder
		Stub of Access .mdb present in ./?
		What file ends up open? (original file as it stood)
		Git commit window is open, not modal.
		
	Method:
		- Copy database file (as in VBScript version)
		- Work from copy
			- Export all tables, modules, etc.
			- Remove all tables, modules, etc.
			- Leave as stub
				Q:	What remains in a stub that is otherwise not saveable?
					Is there a way to save this data as, say, XML and restore it later?
		- Call Git command



Scenario 2: Build from source

	Start Conditions:
		Working with .mdb in folder that is a Git repo.
		Addin has been installed.
		Export has been done at least once (but this will have to be checked)
		
	End Conditions:
		New version of .mdb has been built from the source files
		New version of .mdb is open
		
	Method:
		Check if /src files exist
		Check if .mdb stub exists
			Y?	Then prompt to export first:
				"This will build a new .mdb file based on the state of this database when it was last exported."
				"Do you want to export the database now, and end up with a copy of the db as it now stands?"
			N?	Then prompt to export first:
				"This database has not yet been exported to source files."
				"You need to export the database before building a new version."
				"Do you want to export the database now and continue the build, or cancel the build?"
		Copy stub
		Import all source files into stub
		Archive original if possible
		Rename stub to something appropriate
